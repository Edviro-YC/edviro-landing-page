# edviro-landing-page

The Edviro marketing site (Vue 3 + Vite, prerendered with vite-ssg, deployed on Netlify at `edviroenergy.com`).

Positioning: Edviro is an **AI-powered facilities operations platform** (technical category: AI-native operations and maintenance platform). The shared surfaces — homepage, default metadata, nav, footer, schema, `public/llms.txt` — are industry-neutral and name the industries explicitly (data centers, education, commercial real estate, healthcare, construction). Education is where the proof comes from today, so it appears as labeled education proof below the neutral product story rather than as the category definition. Energy management is a major entry point, not the product boundary; the school energy/O&M/work-order/CMMS/asset pages keep their school-specific titles, canonicals, and structured data. Canonical copy lives in `src/seo/site.ts` and the "What is Edviro?" Notion page.

Evidence gating: the homepage report excerpts and procurement badge are built but hidden behind `showEvidence` / `showProcurement` in `src/pages/HomePage.vue` until the figures, permissions, and listing wording are signed off. Every metric and logo carries an owner/source comment where it is defined.

## The Edviro ecosystem

Edviro is an AI-powered facilities operations platform for K-12 school districts — energy monitoring, diagnostics, work orders, assets, and capital planning in one place. Six repos, one shared data plane:

| Repo | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `flask-server` | Python backend — Cloud Run API + nightly Fargate ML pipeline |
| `edviro-dashboard` | React operator dashboard (Netlify-hosted, Supabase-backed) |
| `edviro-caseagent` | Cloudflare Worker — LLM ResolutionAgent that works anomaly cases end-to-end |
| `edviro-mobile-app` | React Native app — district energy views via Supabase under RLS |
| `edviro-landing-page` | Marketing site — this repo |
| `edviro-blog` | Astro blog |

**Shared data plane:** Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage + Edge Functions). District-scoped RLS is the authorization boundary; backend jobs use the service role.

**Architecture source of truth:** the [Edviro Architecture](https://app.notion.com/p/3a1e1e5ee06481c7ab24f4e8db322027) Notion page and its component pages, mirrored as the Monoid canvas "Edviro Architecture" (id `cab10eba-96ba-49ef-aec0-22959c08e5c2`). Agents: fetch pages via the Notion MCP; explore component relationships via the Monoid MCP (`get_canvas`, `get_node_context`).

## Docs map

This repo has no dedicated Notion component page; start from the [Edviro Architecture](https://app.notion.com/p/3a1e1e5ee06481c7ab24f4e8db322027) index. Product positioning lives in the "What is Edviro?" Notion page.

## Vue template notes

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue (Official)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Recommended Browser Setup

- Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.):
  - [Vue.js devtools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd)
  - [Turn on Custom Object Formatter in Chrome DevTools](http://bit.ly/object-formatters)
- Firefox:
  - [Vue.js devtools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vue-js-devtools/)
  - [Turn on Custom Object Formatter in Firefox DevTools](https://fxdx.dev/firefox-devtools-custom-object-formatters/)

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production
